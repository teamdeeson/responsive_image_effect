# üñºÔ∏è Responsive image generator.

This module allows the programatic generation of responsive images.  Note this image style will not work with any of Drupal's normal theming mechanisms and this module should only be used by those with full control over their theme or delivering code in a headless environment.

Given an image file called `test.png` in the public file, i.e. `sites/default/files/test.png`

Then it is possible to generate responsive image URLs of the form:

https://site.localhost/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/{width}/{height}/{crop}/test.png?itok={itok}

Where the parameters are as follows:

* {width} - the width in pixels (e.g. 1024)
* {height} - the height in pixels (e.g. 768)
* {crop} - a 1 or 0 to designate whether to use a crop to force the image to the exact dimensions specified (1 or 0). If set to 0 then the image may be taller or wider than the dimensions specified but nothing will be lost.
* {itok}: Drupal's security token to ensure only URLs generated by Drupal can be used. Without this the server could be Denial of service attacked.

For example, this generates a cropped 400 x 400 image:
https://site.localhost/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/400/400/1/test.png?itok=fsdkjfksdj

## üê£ Getting started.

Add the following to the `repositories` section of your site's `composer.json` file

```javascript
    {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "https://github.com/teamdeeson/responsive_image_effect.git"
    }
```

You can then run `composer require teamdeeson/responsive_image_effect` to download the module and `drush @docker en responsive_image_effect` to enable the module.

Your site will need at least one Drupal image style which includes the responsive image effect.

## ü§ñ Generating image URLs.

To generate the URLs, a Utility service is available:

```php
    $responsiveImageEffectService = \Drupal::getContainer()->get('responsive_image_effect.responsive_image_service');
    $fileUri = 'public://test.png';
    
    // Create a resized image preserving original aspect ratio with a width of 100px.
    // "https://site.localhost/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/100/0/0/test.png?itok=fsdkjfksdj"
    $src = $responsiveImageEffectService->responsiveImageUrl($fileUri, ['w' => 100]);
    
    // Create an image 400px wide with the height a maximum ratio of 0.75 (3/4 of width).
    // "https://site.localhost/sites/default/files/styles/responsive/public/400/300/1/test.png?itok=fsdkjfksdj"
    $src = $responsiveImageEffectService->responsiveImageUrl($fileUri, $responsiveImageEffectService->crop(400, 0.75));
    
    // Create a srcset set of images.
    $srcset = $responsiveImageEffectService->makeSrcset($fileUri, [ ['w' => 100, 'h' => 100, 'c' => FALSE], ['w' => 200, 'h' => 200, 'c' => FALSE], ['w' => 300, 'h' => 300, 'c' => FALSE] ]);
```

## ‚úÇ Cropping.

The module makes use of the [focal point](https://drupal.org/project/focal_point) module for cropping to centre any crop dimensions around a given point.

## üñáÔ∏è Drush command utility.

There is a drush command file which allows you to generate URLs.

The general form is:

`drush @docker rig [media_entity_id] [width] [height (optional)] [--crop|--crop=ratio (optional)]`

Where:
 
 * media_entity_id is the entity id of a media entity in Drupal with an image file attached.
 * width is a width in pixels
 * height is a height in pixels (optional)
 * --crop can be used on its own to force the specified width and height
 * --crop=ratio can be used instead of specifying the height which will be calculated from the given ration (e.g. 0.5)

e.g. the following drush command generates a URL for an image with entity id 5, width 300 and height of 210 (0.7 x 300)

`drush @docker rig 5 300 --crop=0.7`

e.g. the following drush command generates a URL for an image with entity id 5, width 300 and height of 500 with a crop

`drush @docker rig 5 500 500 --crop`

e.g. the following drush command generates a URL for an image with entity id 5, width 300 and height of 210 (0.7 x 300) and specifies an image style called low-res

`drush @docker rig 5 300 --crop=0.7 --style=low_res`

# Known issues

In order to make this compatible with Stage File Proxy a service within Stage File Proxy needed to be overwritten. On Drupal
9 this can be done selectivley if the service is there. On Drupal 8 the service has to be there so when used on Drupal 8
this module expects stage file proxy to be enabled, even in production.
